# Organization-wide GitHub Configuration

This repository holds the default configuration files and templates that apply to all repositories within our organization. Its primary purpose is to ensure consistency and set standards across our projects.

## Contents

1. **Pull Request Template**:
   - The default template for pull requests to ensure consistency in PR submissions.
   - [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md)

## Usage

When a new repository is created under our organization, GitHub checks for default files in this repository and uses them if no repository-specific files are present.
